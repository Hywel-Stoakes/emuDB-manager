# emuDB Manager

The emuDB manager is a part of the [EMU Speech Database Management System](https://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html).

The EMU-SDMS is a collection of software tools for the creation, manipulation and analysis of speech databases. At the core of the EMU-SDMS is a database search engine which allows the researcher to find various speech segments based on the sequential and hierarchical structure of the utterances in which they occur.

The emuDB Manager is a web front-end for research groups to manage a 
collection of EMU speech databases. It allows:

* Uploading, merging and renaming databases
* Creating and archiving bundle lists (bundle lists make a part of the 
database visible online to a certain editor and allows the editor to make 
changes and comments)
* Evaluating the online comments from editors
